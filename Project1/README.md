One student from each group should upload a .zip file to Gradescope containing all of your project files.
We’ll be primarily focusing on utils.c and your README, which should contain the following
information:

Project group number
● Group member names and x500s
● The name of the CSELabs computer that you tested your code on
○ e.g. csel-kh1250-01.cselabs.umn.edu
● Any changes you made to the Makefile or existing files that would affect grading
● Plan outlining individual contributions for each member of your group
● Plan on how you are going to implement the process tree component of creating the Merkle tree
(high-level pseudocode would be acceptable/preferred for this part)
