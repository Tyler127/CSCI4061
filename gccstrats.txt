gcc 

project code: p1.c

use: gcc -c p1.c
gives object file: p1.o

use: gcc -o p1.out p1.0
gives runnable file: p1.out

use: gcc -o p1.out p1.c
gives runnable file: p1.out

run with: ./p1.out

gcc flags

-c : Unlinked non executable files, good for when multiple files
-o : Name the object file gives executable object file
-g : Debug flag. Prevents over complication of assembly code.

makefiles

- controls generation of executables
- set of rules to complete an action or generate files
- rule structure:
    target: prerequisites ...
            recipe
            ...
- prerequisites : action or file that is required for the target
- recipe : one or more actions carried out by make to 
           generate target file or action
- example:
    p1.o: p1.c
          gcc -c p1.c
    p1.out: p1.o 
          gcc -o p1.out p1.o 

---

usage

- execute default / first rule 
    $make 
- execute specific rule 
    $make p1.out 
- repeated calls to same make will compile code only if change in dependencies
